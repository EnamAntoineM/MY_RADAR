### Description

my_radar is an air traffic graphical simulation.
Planes fly from one control tower to the other and reset when they reach their
destination or collide with one another.
Two planes colliding within a tower control area are not destroyed and can
continue on their way.

### Usage
To run the program use the following command: ./my_radar [path to the script]

A script file determines the positions of the towers, the starting towers of
each plane, as well as its speed and delay before take off.
There are scripts to test the program under the tests/ directory.
